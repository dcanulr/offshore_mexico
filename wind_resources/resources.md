Wind speeds are calculated for the Gulf of Mexico at 90 and 119 m, hub heights of the NREL and DTU wind turbines respectively, the average wind speeds for the 39 years are shown in figure \ref{fig:wind_res}. The maximum average values are identified in both models between 8 and 9 m s$^{-1}$ in the same two areas: at the northwest of the Gulf (at the north of the Tamaulipas coast) and the northwest of the Yucatan Peninsula. The differences between the wind speeds at different heights are minimal, and also between models, however, ERA5 shows largger areas with the same maximum values. The minimal wind speeds (5 m s$^{-1}$) are presented along the coast of Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo. The identification of these areas are consistent with those reported by Haces-Fernandez, Li, and Ramirez \cite{h_fernandez} and in the Global Wind Atlas \cite{global_atlas}, using different numerical tools.\\

The annual average wind speeds at 119 m for each year from 1980 to 2018 have been computed for both reanalyses
